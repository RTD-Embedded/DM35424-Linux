This software has been validated on the following CPU architectures.
 
* x86_64 (64-bit) multi-core
* ARM64 multi-core


## Supported Compilers


The driver software and example programs were compiled using the GNU gcc 
compiler, but can be ported to other C compilers by the customers. 
                            
                            
## Driver


The directory `driver/` contains source code related to the driver.


In order to use a driver, one must first compile it, load it into the kernel,
and create device files for the board(s).  To do this, issue the following
commands while sitting in the `driver/` directory:

```sh
make
sudo make load
```


The driver module must be loaded before running any program which accesses a
DM35424 device.


## Library Interface


The directory `lib/` contains source code related to the user library.


The DM35424 library is created with a file name of `librtd-dm35424.a` and is
statically linked.


Please refer to the software manual for details on using the user level library
functions.  These functions are prototyped in the file `include/dm35424_library.h`;
this header file must be included in any code which wishes to call library
functions.


The library must be built before compiling the example programs or your
application.


To build the library, issue the command `make` within `lib/`.


## Header Files


The directory `include/` contains all header files needed by the driver, example
programs, library, and user applications.


## Example Programs


The directory `examples/` contains source code related to the example programs,
which demonstrate how to use features of the DM35424 boards, test the driver, or
test the library.  In addition to source files, `examples/` holds other files as
well; the purpose of these files will be explained below.


To build the example programs, issue the command `make` within `examples/`.


The following files are provided in `examples/`:

### Makefile

Make description file for building example programs.

### [dm35424_adc.c](examples/dm35424_adc.c)

This example program demonstrates the use of the ADC and interrupt
handling.  An interrupt is generated each time an ADC has taken a 
sample.  When that interrupt happens, the programs gets the value
of the last sample and displays it on the screen.
            
As a convenience, the onboard DAC will be setup to generate a
suitable signal for the ADC to read.
            
Setup: Connect the signal of interest to the ADC Channel+ pin,  
Channel- pin and GND.  If using the onboard DAC instead, connect
DAC Channel 0 to ADC Channel 0+ and ADC Channel 1-,
and DAC Channel 1 to ADC Channel 0- and ADC Channel 1+.  Repeat 
for remaining ADC channels.
            
Usage: Display the command-line options by executing 
                           
```sh
./dm35424_adc --help
```
            
Hit CTRL-C to exit.

### [dm35424_adc_continuous_dma.c](examples/dm35424_adc_continuous_dma.c)
            
This example program demonstrates the use of the ADC and DMA.  The 
example will collect data from the ADC via DMA, and then write the
data out to a file on disk.  The data can then be plotted using 
gnuplot and the plot_adc_dma file.

As a convenience, the onboard DAC will be setup to generate a
suitable signal for the ADC to read.
            
Setup: Connect the signal of interest to the ADC Channel+ pin,  
Channel- pin and GND.  If using the onboard DAC to generate the
signal, connect DAC Channel 0 to ADC Channel 0+ and ADC Channel 1-,
and DAC Channel 1 to ADC Channel 0- and ADC Channel 1+.  Repeat 
for remaining ADC channels.
            
Usage: Display the command-line options by executing
                           
```sh
./dm35424_adc_continuous --help
```

Hit CTRL-C to exit.

### [dm35424_dac.c](examples/dm35424_dac.c)

This example program demonstrates the use of the DAC.  A voltage is
put out on the pin corresponding to the input from the user.  The voltage
can be easily changed to cover the full range of -5V to 5V.
            
Setup: Connect an oscilloscope to the DACx Channel 0-3 pins associated with
the DAC in use.
            
Usage: Usage: Display the command-line options by executing
            		
```sh
./dm35424_dac --help
```
            		
Follow the prompts on screen for changing the voltage.

### [dm35424_dac_dma.c](examples/dm35424_dac_dma.c)
            
This example program demonstrates the use of the DAC and DMA.  Wave
pattern data is generated in the program, written to a DMA buffer,
and then sent to the DAC in a repeating loop, thus providing a
continuous cycling signal.
            
The data for each odd-numbered channel will be a half-cycle out of
phase with the even-numbered channels, for viewability on the scope.
            
Setup: Connect an oscilloscope to the DACx Channel 0-3 pins associated with
the DAC in use.
            
Usage: Display the command-line options by executing
            		
```sh
./dm35424_dac_dma --help
```

### [dm35424_dio.c](examples/dm35424_dio.c)

This example program demonstrates the use of the DIO.  It configures
half of the pins as output, and the other half as input.  Then, 
using a loopback connector, data is written to the output pins and 
read from the input pins, and then verified to be correct.
            
Setup: This example requires a loopback from DIO Port 0:0 to
Port 0:7, Port 0:1 to Port 0:8, etc.
            
Usage:

```sh
./dm35424_dio --minor 0
```

### [dm35424_list_fb.c](examples/dm35424_list_fb.c)

This example program demonstrates accessing the board-level 
registers to access the function blocks on the board.  The 
program will query every function block location to see if a 
valid function block type exists there, and if it does, it will
display that type on the screen.  In this way, it will give an
inventory of the function blocks on the board.
            
Setup: No setup required.
            
Usage:

```sh
./dm35424_list_fb --minor 0
```

### [dm35424_ref_adjust.c](examples/dm35424_ref_adjust.c)


This example program demonstrates using the reference adjustment 
value to adjust the value reported by the ADC or sent by the DAC.
The example allows for setting an adjustment value, and then
writing that value to the appropriate memory location.
            
The reference voltage source should be attached to the differential
inputs of ADC0 or ADC1 (depending on which reference adjustment you
are using).  The voltage reading from the ADC will be displayed on
the screen, allowing you to view the effect reference value changes has
            on the measured voltage.
            
For purposes of running the example, and for convenience, the 
onboard DACs will be set to supply a value of 2 volts.  You can then
loopback the DAC outputs into the ADC inputs, as described below.
            
Note that the supplied DAC outputs should not be considered a 
reference voltage source for the purposes of calibrating the
board.
            
WARNING: This example will allow you to change the preset
calibration values on the board.  Do not do so unless you
understand the risks of permanently changing that value.
            
Setup: Attach a reference voltage source to the ADC Channel 0-
and Channel 0+ pins.  If using the onboard DACs, connect DAC
Channel 0 to ADC Channel 0+ and DAC Channel 1 to ADC Channel 0-.
            
Usage: Display the command-line options by executing

```sh
./dm35424_ref_adjust --help
```

### [dm35424_temperature.c](examples/dm35424_temperature.c)

This example program demonstrates the temperature sensor on the board.
It will continually display the temperature on the screen until
stopped.

Press CTRL-C to exit.

Setup: No setup required.

Usage:

```sh
./dm35424_temperature --minor 0
```


## Known Limitations

 1. This software was tested only on little-endian processors.  If you are using
    a big-endian CPU, you will need to examine the driver, example, and library
    source code for endianness issues and resolve them.

 2. Many conditions affect board throughput and interrupt performance.  For a
    discussion of these issues, please see the Application Note SWM-640000021
    (Linux Interrupt Performance) available on our web site.

 3. If you are using the interrupt wait mechanism, be aware that signals
    delivered to the application can cause the sleep to awaken prematurely.
    Interrupts may be missed if signals are delivered rapidly enough or at
    inopportune times.
